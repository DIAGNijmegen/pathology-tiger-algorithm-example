# Example processing with HookNet

You can find a concrete example of implementing a segmentation model in the processing.py file in this folder.
In this example, we use HookNet and change the processing loop accordingly to fit the requirements for HookNet. For more information about HookNet, please follow this [link](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-hooknet). This example only shows the segmentation part. The detection and computation of a TILS score have been removed for clarity. Please note that your implementation probably requires different changes for other models and different settings.
